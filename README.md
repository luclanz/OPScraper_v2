This is a quick script to download the weekly One Piece chapter that every friday gets published in the TCB website.

I've implemented a "smart" engine that will automatically remove the irrelevant pages (fanart, adds, notes etc.) and select the 17 original images for the chapter. After that a new pdf is generated with the same layout as a manga (8 splash pages and 1 title page).

Next steps: 

    * create an algorith that automatically finds the title of the chapter in the first page and use that for the pdf title.
    * update the selection algorithm in case changes are made with the images format from TCB
